## Context
This weather app was developed as a practice project to improve my web development skills. I wanted to experiment with different technologies, design patterns, and APIs to create a functional and user-friendly weather app.

## Technologies
This app was built using webpack, vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I chose to use webpack to bundle my code and optimize the app's performance. Vanilla JavaScript was used to manipulate the DOM and fetch data from the OpenWeather API. HTML and CSS were used to create the app's structure and style.

## Features
The weather app displays the current weather for today and the daily forecast for the next 5 days using data from the OpenWeather API. It includes a button that allows users to switch units of measurement from degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius. The app also includes a live clock that updates in real-time.

I separated the app's data, presentation, and logic. This helped me create a scalable and maintainable codebase. I also implemented error handling to provide a better user experience in case the API fails to fetch data.

Overall, this project helped me gain experience in working with APIs, design patterns, and different web technologies. I hope you find this weather app useful and informative.
